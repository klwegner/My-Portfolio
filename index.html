<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have always held a wild desire to learn and use what I know to help others. 
    Working as an educator and freelance content writer in the 21st century allowed me plenty of opportunity for both,
     using technology, but...
    </p>

<p>
I wanted to learn how to create the technology I relied upon. 
Thus, learning web development was a natural next step. 
I enrolled in Ironhack's web development course, dove into the world of web dev, and haven't looked back!
</p>

<p>
I believe in the power that coding holds to make our lives richer, healthier, and happier.
 With coding bootcamp behind me, I continue to channel my thirst for knowledge into study and practice with React, Node, and other JavaScript frameworks.
  I'm eager to begin my career as a full-stack developer and craft code that does its part to make our world a better place.

<p>A simple game that combines basic JS with one of my other loves, literature. <br><br> Inspired by the classic Brothers Grimm fairytale "The Juniper Tree," you must avenge your death at the hands of your twisted stepmother. <br> Warning: not optimized for small screens.</p>

        <p> Finding ridiculous posts on social media is a common pastime. I wanted to build a site that could host a slew of them for easy access! Thus, Cringe was born. <br><br>Cringe is a social media-style app dedicated to compiling "cringe" pictures. It is made with HTML, CSS, Handlebars, and NodeJs and features CRUD capabilities.</p>

        <a href="https://main--gilded-profiterole-8a135b.netlify.app/">Under the Sun</a>
<p> Because of its ties-in with history, literature, and ecology, travel is one of my most beloved hobbies. I made Under the Sun to help myself remember all the things I want to see in my life. <br><Br>Users list places to go/things to do--and then keep track of what they have done and what is still left to do. This application is made with the MERN stack and allowed me to further my experience in utilizing APIs.</p>
